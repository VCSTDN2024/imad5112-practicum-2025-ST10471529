2. Project Overview
-------------------
## Project Overview

The **Music Playlist Manager app** is a mobile application developed as part of a practicum in the IMAD5112 subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to allow the user to input song information, add that to a playlist and give a rating aswell as calculate the average of that app's rating.

The app was created to meet the requirements of the practicums guidlines.

3. App Purpose and Features

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to allow the user to see the rating average of the songs information they had placed into the app. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: Ease of access to the app with clear information on what to do.
- Feature 2:Provide a vissually appealing look to the app.
- Feature 3: Have a message pop up showing the user to enter all the fields into the designated editTexts.

These features aim to provide a fun and easy way to view the screens and get an idea of the specific information needed for the understaning of what people rate the song youve inputed.

4. Design Considerations
------------------------
## Design Considerations

The design of the **Music playlist manager app** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience aswell as a easy to understand the information on the app.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility. The app also responds reasinalbly fast when the user does certain inputs.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design has a mix of simplicity but complexity aswell which all comes together to form a decent and good looking app.

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality. I have also pushed my code through cmd.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

6. Screenshots and App Demo

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------
## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: 
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge, e.g., "I researched Firebase authentication and successfully integrated it into the app."]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [Describe another challenge, e.g., "Debugging issues related to Gradle builds."]
   - **Solution**: [How you solved the challenge.]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

8. Future Enhancements
---------------------
## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: Allow the user to insert the Album name of the song and where it came from.
2. **Feature 2**: Able to view the users time of day they made that log on the app for reserch purposes>
3. **Feature 3**: Make adjustments to the information when a new playlist was created so that the user can add their thoughts about the playlist of songs.

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
